# Welcome to My Portfolio

I've decided to study Applied Statistics at RIT in Rochester, NY in 2021. During Covid Quarantine in 2020, I kept thinking about what else I can learn and how to grow and gain more skills. Statistics, programming, and public speaking are all daunting subjects to me. But I believe with more practice, I'll get better at it. I'm almost at the finish line in December 2023. <br><br/>
I've learned: <br><br/>
-R programming in RStudio <br><br/>
-RMarkdown to make my reports <br><br/>
-Minitab software <br><br/>
-JMP software <br><br/>

And I've enrolled in Data Analysis Accelerator bootcamp to create projects in: <br><br/>
-Excel <br><br/>
-Tableau <br><br/>
-SQL <br><br/>
-R <br><br/>
-Python <br><br/>
